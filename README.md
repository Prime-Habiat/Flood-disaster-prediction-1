# Flood Disaster Pediction
Due to recent *climate change* related issues critical floods of urban areas have started becoming more
and more common. Hence, a software able to estimate the likelihood of such an event could be a useful
tool in order to prevent the most dramatic scenarios.
For this reason we proposed the implementation of a *Bayesian Network* to model the likelihood of
floods in various municipalities of the Italian region Veneto. The structure of the network was inspired
by the paper *Assessing urban flood disaster risk using Bayesian network model and GIS applications*
[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19475705.2019.1685010], although quite deeply modified for didactic reasons.
The project was developed in *Python* using the `pgmpy` library.
